yield: 12
preptime: 40 Minutes

ingredients:

- Nonstick cooking spray
- 1/2 c. pecan halves
- 14 graham crackers (full sheets)
- 3 tbsp. granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 cup butter

- 4 8 Ounce blocks of cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 Cup granulated sugar
- 1 /2 Cup packed light brown sugar
- 4 Large eggs
- 1 15 Ounce can pumpkin puree
- 1/3 Cup sour cream 
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch
- 1/4 Tsp salt
- 1 Tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 Tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 Tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 Tsp ground cardamom
- Chopped pecans, caramel sauce and/or whipped cream, to garnish 

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350˚. Wrap the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with two layers of aluminum foil, allowing the foil to come a couple inches up the sides of the pan. (This prevents water from seeping into the pan while the cheesecake cooks in a water bath.) Lightly coat the inside of the pan with cooking spray.
- Place the pecan halves and the graham crackers in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until fine crumbs form. Add the sugar and salt and pulse to combine. Drizzle in the melted butter and process until well combined. 
- Press the crumb mixture evenly along the bottom and partially up the sides of the pan. Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool.

- Beat the cream cheese and sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed, 2 to 3 minutes, until combined and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Lower the mixer speed and beat in the eggs, one at a time, until just incorporated. Beat in the pumpkin, sour cream, and vanilla until combined. With the mixer on low, beat in the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom.
- Bring a pot of water to a boil for your cheesecake’s water bath.
- Pour the filling into the crust. Place the cheesecake in the center of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the boiling water into the roasting pan. (The water should come about halfway up the sides of the pan). 
- Bake the cheesecake for 65 to 75 minutes, until the cheesecake is firm around the edges, but the center has a slight jiggle. Turn the oven off, crack the oven door just slightly (you can use a wooden spoon to keep the door slightly open), and allow the cheesecake to rest in the oven for 1 additional hour. 
- Carefully remove the cheesecake from the water bath. Place the springform pan on a cooling rack until it cools to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours.
- When ready to serve, remove the sides of the springform pan and garnish the cheesecake with chopped pecans, caramel sauce or whipped cream, if you like. 

notes:
- This was John's favorite cheescake recipe.
