category: Dinner
yield: 4

directions:
- Prepare the dough
- While the dough is rising, prepare the filling and set aside.
- Place an overturned rimmed baking sheet or pizza stone inside the oven and preheat it to 450°F. 
- Crack 4 eggs into separate small bowls. 
- Cut four 5x8-inch pieces of parchment paper and set aside.
- Punch down the dough and transfer it to a well-floured surface. Divide into four equal pieces. 
- Take one piece (keeping the others covered) and gently round it out with your fingers into a 4 to 5-inch circle. Use a rolling pin to roll it out to a 10-inch circle, keeping the edges slightly thicker than the center.
- Take one edge of the circle and tightly roll it toward the center about a third of the way. Repeat with the opposite side. Pinch and twist the ends, pulling outward slightly, and pinch again to seal—forming a boat shape.
- Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper and place the shaped dough on top. 
- Take one of the cheese balls, place it in the center of the cavity, and press it down lightly to spread and pack the cheese evenly. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. 
- Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven (skip this if using a pizza stone). Holding the edges of the parchment paper, transfer the khachapuri onto the hot baking sheet (or stone). 
- Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until the dough is lightly golden and the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven.
- Working with one khachapuri at a time, carefully make a well in the cheese with a fork. Slide an egg into the well, being careful not to break the yolk. Return to the oven and bake for 3 to 4 more minutes, until the egg whites have set and the khachapuri is deep golden brown.
