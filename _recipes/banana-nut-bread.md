yield: 1 9 x 5 loaf

ingredients:
- 3 overly ripe Bananas
- 1 1/2 Cups All-Purpose Flour
- 3/4 Cup Sugar
- 1/3 Cup unsalted Butter, melted
- 1/4 Cup chopped Walnuts
- 1 Large Egg
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 Pinch Salt

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
- Spray the bottom of your 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
- In a bowl, mash the bananas and then stir in the melted butter.
- Stir in all of the remaining ingredients. 
- Pour batter into the loaf pan. The batter will be thick, that is ok.

notes:
- Use overly ripe bananas, most groceries stores sell these in a bag near the regular bananas, and they are dirt cheap!
