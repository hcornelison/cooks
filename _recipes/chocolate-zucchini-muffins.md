## Ingredients
- 2 Cups AP flour
- 1/2 Cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 Cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 Cup light brown sugar
- 2 Tsp baking powder
- 1 Tsp baking soda
- 1/2 Tsp salt
- 1 Large egg
- 5 Tbsp unsalted butter melted
- 1 Tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 Cup skim milk
- 3/4 Cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 finely shredded zucchini on the small to medium size

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a muffin tin with nonstick spray or line with muffin liners. Set aside.
- In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, sugars, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Add skim milk and stir until combined. Fold in shredded zucchini and chocolate chips (batter will be thick).
- Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups and place in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let muffins cool in muffin pan until theyâ€™re safe to handle, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes
- Do not peel the zucchini!
