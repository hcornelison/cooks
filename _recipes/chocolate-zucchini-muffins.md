yield: 18 Muffins
preptime: 15 Minutes
cooktime: 25 Minutes

ingredients:
- 2 Cups All Purpose Flour
- 1/2 Cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
- 1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Light Brown Sugar
- 2 teaspoons Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt
- 1 Large Egg
- 5 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1 Cup Skim Milk
- 3/4 Cup Semisweet Chocolate Chips
- 1 small to medium size zucchini, finely shredded

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a muffin tin with nonstick spray or line with muffin liners. Set aside.
- In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, sugars, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Add skim milk and stir until combined. Fold in shredded zucchini and chocolate chips (batter will be thick).
- Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups and place in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let muffins cool in muffin pan until they’re safe to handle, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

notes:
- Do not peel the zucchini!
