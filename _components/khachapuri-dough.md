title: Khachapuri Dough

ingredients:
- 3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted, plus more as needed
- 1 1/3 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/3 teaspoons sugar
- 1 1/3 teaspoons instant dry (or rapid-rise) yeast
- 1 1/3 cups water, warmed
- 4 tablespoons sunflower or vegetable oil, plus more for greasing

directions:
- In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, and instant dry yeast. 
- Make a well and add warmed water and oil. 
- Start mixing with a wooden spoon, then switch to using your hands once the dough comes together. 
- Knead until the dough is soft and elastic (it should be softer than your earlobe when pinched). If the dough is too wet, add a bit more flour; if too dense, add a bit more water. 
- Once kneaded, pour some oil into your hand and grease the sides of the bowl, forming the dough into a ball. 
- Cover with a damp clean kitchen towel and let it rest in a warm place.
- After about 1 hour, or when the dough has doubled in size, carefully grab an edge and stretch it over itself towards the opposite side. 
- Repeat with remaining edges, turn the dough over, and gently form it into a ball. 
- Set aside for 30 minutes before use.
